V1.0
- Doctor pawns perform critical doctoring tasks before going to sleep if the job is marked as Priority 1 in the Work Tab. They have also been internally reprioritised into a more sensible order if they are set at the same priority in the Work Tab.

 - 100 = Highest Priority

 - Tend to Critical Patient - 100(default) - Pawns are tagged as critical if they will die in less than 12000 ticks(less than 6 in-game hours)
 - Tend to Self - 95(was 65)
 - Rescue Pawn - 90(default)
 - Tend to Patient - 85(was 70) - "Humanlikes" only

CREDIT

While all code in this mod is my own, credit is due to BritNoth who designed Patient Sanity, a similar mod that helped me understand what I was doing.
